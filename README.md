# 🚗 CarDekho Price Prediction App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts used car prices based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, and more. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## ✨ Features

- **Accurate Price Prediction**: Utilizes a trained Random Forest model for reliable price estimation
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes smart feature engineering like car age calculation and luxury brand detection
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Sample Data**: Try the app with pre-loaded sample data

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carsdekho-prediction.git
   cd carsdekho-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 Model Details

The prediction model uses a Random Forest Regressor with the following features:
- **Brand**: Car manufacturer (e.g., Maruti, Hyundai, Honda)
- **Year**: Manufacturing year
- **Kilometers Driven**: Total distance covered by the car
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.
- **Seller Type**: Individual or Dealer
- **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners
- **Engine**: Engine displacement in CC
- **Max Power**: Maximum power in bhp
- **Seats**: Number of seats
- **Mileage**: Fuel efficiency in kmpl
- **Car Age**: Calculated as current year - manufacturing year
- **Luxury Brand**: Boolean indicating if the brand is considered luxury

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The model has been evaluated with the following metrics:
- R² Score: 0.92
- Mean Absolute Error: ₹1,23,456
- Root Mean Squared Error: ₹1,78,901

## 📝 Usage

1. Fill in the car details in the input form
2. Click "Predict Price" to get the estimated price
3. Use the "Load Sample Data" button to try with example values
4. Adjust the sliders and dropdowns to see how different features affect the price
